Since the time that the iOS and Android platforms exploded onto the scene a decade ago, **cross-platform development** has been a goal across the mobile development world. The ability to write one app for both iOS and Android can save significant time and effort for your company and team.

There have been various tools released for cross-platform development over the years, including web-based tools such as **[PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com)** from Adobe, powerful frameworks such as **[Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/)** from Microsoft, and newer tools such as **[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)** from Facebook. Each toolset has pros and cons and they have met with varying degrees of success in the mobile industry.

A more recent framework to enter the cross-platform arena is **<a href="https://flutter.io/">Flutter</a>** from Google, which was announced in February at Mobile World Congress 2018 to be <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/02/announcing-flutter-beta-1.html">entering a beta phase</a>. Flutter features fast development cycles, fast UI rendering and unique UI design, and native app performance on both platforms.

## Introduction to Flutter

Flutter apps are written using the **<a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>** programming language, also originally from Google and now an ECMA standard. Dart shares many of the same features as other modern languages such as Kotlin and Swift, and can be transcompiled into JavaScript code.

As a cross-platform framework, Flutter most closely resembles React Native, as Flutter allows for a **reactive** and **declarative** style of programming. Unlike React Native, however, Flutter does not need to use a Javascript bridge, which can improve app startup times and overall performance. Dart achieves this by using **Ahead-Of-Time** or AOT compilation. 

Another unique aspect of Dart is that it can also use **Just-In-Time** or JIT compilation. JIT compilation with Flutter improves the development workflow by allowing **hot reload** capability to refresh the UI during development without the need for an entirely new build.

As you'll see in this tutorial, the Flutter framework is heavily built around the idea of **widgets**. In Flutter, widgets are not used just for the views of your app, but also for entire screens and even for the app itself.

In addition to cross-platform iOS and Android development, learning Flutter will also give you a head start on developing for the **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia">Fuschia</a>** platform, which is currently an experimental operating system in development at Google. Fuschia is thought by many to be a potential future replacement for Android.

In this tutorial, you'll build a Flutter app that queries the **<a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/members/">GitHub API</a>** for team members in a GitHub organization and displays the team member information in a scrollable list:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/finalapp.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/finalapp-571x500.png" alt="Final apps" width="571" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188637" /></a>

You can develop the app while using either the iOS Simulator, the Android emulator, or both!

In building out the app, you'll learn the following about Flutter:

<ul>
<li>Setting up your development environment</li>
<li>Creating a new project</li>
<li>Hot reload</li>
<li>Importing files and packages</li>
<li>Using widgets and creating your own</li>
<li>Making network calls</li>
<li>Showing items in a list</li>
<li>Adding an app theme</li>
</ul>

You'll also learn a little Dart along the way! :]

## Getting Started

Flutter development can be done on macOS, Linux, or Windows. While you can use any editor with the Flutter toolchain, there are IDE plugins for both **<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html">Android Studio</a>** and **<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>** that can ease the development cycle. We'll use VS Code for this tutorial.

### Setting up your development environment

Instructions for setting up your development machine with the Flutter framework can be found <a href="https://flutter.io/get-started/install/">here</a>. The basic steps vary by platform, but for the most part are:

<ol>
<li>Clone the Flutter git repository</li>
<li>Add the Flutter bin directory to your path</li>
<li>Run the `flutter doctor` command, which installs the Flutter framework including Dart and alerts you to any missing dependencies</li>
<li>Install missing dependencies</li>
<li>Set up your IDE with a Flutter plugin/extension</li>
<li>Test drive an app</li>
</ol>

The instructions provided on the Flutter web site are very well done and allow you to easily setup a development environment on your platform of choice. The remainder of this tutorial assumes you've setup VSCode for Flutter development, and that you've addressed any issues found by `flutter doctor`.

You should also be able to follow along pretty well if you're using Android Studio. You'll also need to be running either the iOS Simulator, an Android emulator, or have a provisioned iOS device or an Android device setup for development.

<div class="note"><p>**Note**: For building and testing on the iOS Simulator or an iOS device, you'll need to be using macOS with Xcode installed.</p></div>

### Creating a new project

In VS Code with the Flutter extension installed, open the command pallatte by choosing **View > Command Paletteâ€¦** or hitting Cmd-Shift-P on macOS or Ctrl-Shift-P on Linux or Windows. Enter **Flutter: New Project** into the pallette and hit return.

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/newproject.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/newproject-650x137.png" alt="New project" width="650" height="137" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188639" /></a>

Enter the name **ghflutter** for the project and hit return. Select a folder to store the project in, and then wait for Flutter to setup the project in VS Code. When the project is ready, the file **main.dart** will be opened in your editor.

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/projectready.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/projectready-650x406.png" alt="Project ready" width="650" height="406" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188640" /></a>

In VS Code, you see a panel on the left-hand-side that shows your project structure. There are folders for iOS and Android, as well as a **lib** folder that contains **main.dart** and will have code that applies to both platforms. You'll be working in the lib folder only in this tutorial.

Replace the code in main.dart with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(new GHFlutterApp());


class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'GHFlutter',
      home: new Scaffold(
        appBar: new AppBar(
          title: new Text('GHFlutter'),
        ),
        body: new Center(
          child: new Text('GHFlutter'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The `main()` function near the top uses the `=>` operator for a single line function to run the app. You have one class for the app named `GHFlutterApp`.

You see here that your app itself is a `StatelessWidget`. Most entities in a Flutter app are **widgets**, either stateless or stateful. You override the widget `build()` method to create your app widget. You're using the **MaterialApp** widget that provides a number of components needed for apps following Material Design.

For this getting started tutorial, remove the test file **widget_test.dart** in the `test` folder from the project by selecting it and hitting the Delete key.

If you're on macOS, startup the iOS simulator. You can also use an Android emulator on macOS, Linux, or Windows. If both the iOS Simulator and an Android emulator are running, you can switch between them using the menu in the bottom right of the VS Code window:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/switchdevices.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/switchdevices-650x406.png" alt="Switch devices" width="650" height="406" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188641" /></a>

Build and run the project by hitting F5 or choosing **Debug > Start Debugging**. You'll see the **Debug Console** open and, if running on iOS, you'll see Xcode being used to build the project. If running on Android, you'll see Gradle being invoked to do the build.

Here is the app running in the iOS simulator:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/firstiosrun.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/firstiosrun-283x500.png" alt="First iOS run" width="283" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188642" /></a>

And, running in the Android emulator:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/firstandroidrun.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/firstandroidrun-281x500.png" alt="First Android run" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188643" /></a>

The slow mode banner you see indicates that the app is running in a debug mode. 

You can stop the running app by clicking the stop button on the right of the toolbar at the top of the VS Code window:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/toolbar.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/toolbar-650x156.png" alt="The VS Code toolbar" width="650" height="156" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188644" /></a>

You can get back to the project view by clicking the icon in the upper left of VS Code or choosing **View > Explorer**.

## Hot Reload

One of the best aspects of Flutter development is being able to **hot reload** your app as you make changes. This is simlar to something like Android Studio's **Instant Run**. 

Build and run the app so that it's running on the Simulator or an emulator:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/firstandroidrun-1.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/firstandroidrun-1-281x500.png" alt="Before hot reload" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188645" /></a>

Now, without stopping the running app, change the app bar string to something else:

```dart
appBar: new AppBar(
  title: new Text('GHFlutter App'),
),
```

Now click the hot reload button on the toolbar:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/hotreloadbutton.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/hotreloadbutton-650x156.png" alt="Hot reload button" width="650" height="156" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188646" /></a>

Within a second or two you should see the change reflected in the running app:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/hotreload.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/hotreload-281x500.png" alt="After hot reload" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188647" /></a>

Since Flutter is in beta, the hot reload feature may not always work, but overall it's a great time saver when you're building out your UI.

## Importing a File

Rather than keep all your Dart code in the single main.dart file, you'll want to be able to import code from other classes you create. You'll see an example now for importing strings, which will help when you need to localize your user-facing strings.

Create a file named **strings.dart** in the lib folder by right-clicking on **lib** and choosing **New File**:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/newfile.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/newfile-371x500.png" alt="Creating a new file" width="371" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188648" /></a>

Add the following class to the new file:

```dart
class Strings {
  static String appTitle = "GHFlutter";
}
```

Add the following import to the top of **main.dart**

```dart
import 'strings.dart';
```

Update the app title as follows:

```dart
return new MaterialApp(
  title: Strings.appTitle,
```

Change the other strings to use the new strings file so that the `GHFlutterApp` class looks as follows:

```dart
class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: Strings.appTitle,
      home: new Scaffold(
        appBar: new AppBar(
          title: new Text(Strings.appTitle),
        ),
        body: new Center(
          child: new Text(Strings.appTitle),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Build and run the app by hitting F5, and you should see no change, but you're now using strings from the strings file.

## Widgets

Almost every element of your Flutter app is a widget. Widgets are designed to be **immutable**, since using immutable widgets helps keep the app UI lightweight.

There are two fundamental types of widgets you will use:

<ul>
<li>**Stateless**: widgets that depend only upon their own configuration info, such as a static image in an image view.</li>
<li>**Stateful**: widgets that need to maintain dynamic information and do so by interacting with a **State** object.</li>
</ul>

Both stateless and stateful widgets redraw in Flutter apps on every frame, the difference being that the stateful widgets delegate their configuration to a **State** object.

To get started with making your own widgets, create a new class at the bottom of **main.dart**:

```dart
class GHFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  createState() => new GHFlutterState();
}
```

You've made a `StatefulWidget` subclass and you're overriding the `createState()` method to create its state object. Now add a `GHFlutterState` class above `GHFlutter`:

```dart
class GHFlutterState extends State<GHFlutter> {
}
```

`GHFlutterState` extends `State` with a parameter of `GHFlutter`.

The primary task you have when making a new widget is to override the `build()` method that gets called when the widget is rendered to the screen.

Add a `build()` override to `GHFlutterState`:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
â€‹    
}
```

Fill out `build()` as follows:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return new Scaffold (
    appBar: new AppBar(
      title: new Text(Strings.appTitle),
    ),
    body: new Text(Strings.appTitle),
  );
}
```

A **Scaffold** is a container for material design widgets. It acts as the root of a widget hierarchy. You've added an `AppBar` and a `body` to the scaffold, and each contains a `Text` widget.

Update `GHFlutterApp` so that it uses your new `GHFlutter` widget as its `home` attribute, instead of building a scaffold of it's own:

```dart
class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: Strings.appTitle,
      home: new GHFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

Build and run the app, and you'll see the new widget in action:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/ghflutterwidget.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/ghflutterwidget-281x500.png" alt="Using GHFlutter Widget" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188649" /></a>

Not much has changed yet, but now you're setup to build out the new widget.

## Making Network Calls

Earlier you imported your own strings.dart file into the project. You can similarly import other packages that are part of the Flutter framework and Dart.

For example, you'll now use packages available in the framework to make an HTTP network call and also parse the resulting response JSON into Dart objects. Add two new imports at the top of **main.dart**:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import 'strings.dart';
```

You'll see an indicator on the imports that are currently unused.

Dart apps are single-threaded, but Dart provides support for running code on other threads as well as running asynchrounous code that does not block the UI thread using an **async/await** pattern.

You're going to make an asynchronous network call to retrieve a list of GitHub teams members. Add an empty list as a property at the top of `GHFlutterState`, and also add a property to hold a text style:

```dart
var _members = [];

final _biggerFont = const TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0);
```

The underscores at the beginning of the names make the members of the class **private**.

To make the asynchronous HTTP call, add a method `_loadData()` to `GHFlutterState`:

```dart
_loadData() async {
  String dataURL = "https://api.github.com/orgs/raywenderlich/members";
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
  setState(() {
    _members = JSON.decode(response.body);
  });
}
```

You've added the `async` keyword onto `_loadData()` to tell Dart that it's asynchronous, and also the `await` keyword on the `http.get()` call that is blocking. You're using a `dataUrl` value that is set to the GitHub API endpoint that retrieves members for a GitHub organization.

When the HTTP call completes, you pass a callback to `setState()` that runs synchronously on the UI thread. In this case, you are decoding the JSON response and assigning it to the `_members` list.

Add an `initState()` override to `GHFlutterState` that calls `_loadData()` when the state is initialized:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();

  _loadData();
}
```

## Using a ListView

Now that you have a Dart list of members, you need a way to display them in a list in the UI. Dart provides a **ListView** widget that will let you show the data in a list. ListView acts like a **RecyclerView** on Android and a **UITableView** on iOS, recycling views as the user scrolls through the list to achieve smooth scrolling performance.

Add a `_buildRow()` method to `GhHFlutterState`:

```dart
Widget _buildRow(int i) {
  return new ListTile(
    title: new Text("${_members[i]["login"]}", style: _biggerFont)
  );
}
```

You are returning a **ListTile** widget that shows the "login" value parsed from the JSON for the ith member, and also using the text style you created before.

Update the build method to have it's body be a **ListView.builder**:

```dart
body: new ListView.builder(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
  itemCount: _members.length,
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
    return _buildRow(position);
  }),
```

You've added padding, set the `itemCount` to the number of members, and set the `itemBuilder` using `_buildRow()` for a given position.

You can try a hot reload, but you may get a "Full restart may be required" message. If so, hit F5 to build and run the app:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/members.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/members-281x500.png" alt="Showing members" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188650" /></a>

That's just how easy it is to make a network call, parse the data, and show the results in a list!

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/easy-1.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/easy-1-320x320.png" alt="Wow so easy" width="320" height="320" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-188653" /></a>

### Adding dividers

To add dividers into the list, you're going to double the item count, and then return a **Divider** widget when the position in the list is odd:

```dart
body: new ListView.builder(
  itemCount: _members.length * 2,
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
    if (position.isOdd) return new Divider();

      final index = position ~/ 2;

      return _buildRow(index);
    }),
```

Be sure not to miss the * 2 on `itemCount`. You've removed padding from the builder now that you have dividers. In `itemBuilder`, you're either returning a `Divider()`, or instead calculating a new index by integer division and using `_buildRow()` to build a row item.

Try a hot reload and you should see dividers on the list:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/dividers.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/dividers-281x500.png" alt="With dividers" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188654" /></a>

To add padding back into each row, you want to use a `Padding` widget within `_buildRow()`:

```dart
Widget _buildRow(int i) {
  return new Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
    child: new ListTile(
      title: new Text("${_members[i]["login"]}", style: _biggerFont)
    )
  );
}
```

The `ListTile` is now a child widget of the padding widget. Hot reload to see the padding on the rows but not on the dividers.

## Parsing to Custom Types

In the previous section, the JSON parser took each member in the JSON response and added it to the `_members` list as a Dart **Map** type, the equivalent of a **Map** in Kotlin or a **Dictionary** in Swift.

However, you'll also want to be able to use your own custom types.

Add a new `Member` type to the **main.dart** file:

```dart
class Member {
  final String login;

  Member(this.login) {
    if (login == null) {
      throw new ArgumentError("login of Member cannot be null. "
          "Received: '$login'");
    }
  }
}
```

A member has a `login` property and a constructor that throws an error if the login value is null.

Update the `_members` declaration in `GHFlutterState` so that it is a list of `Member` objects:

```dart
var _members = <Member>[];
```

Update `_buildRow()` to use the `login` property on the `Member` object instead of using the "login" key on the map:

```dart
title: new Text("${_members[i].login}", style: _biggerFont)
```

Now update the callback sent to `setState()` in `_loadData()` to turn the decoded map into a `Member` object and add it to the list of members:

```dart
setState(() {
  final membersJSON = JSON.decode(response.body);

  for (var memberJSON in membersJSON) {
    final member = new Member(memberJSON["login"]);
    _members.add(member);
  }
});
```

You'll likely see an error if you try a hot reload, but hit F5 to build and run the app and you should see the same screen as before, except now using your new `Member` class.

## Downloading Images with NetworkImage

Each member from GitHub has a URL for their avatar. You'll now add that avatar to the `Member` class and show the avatars in the app.

Update the `Member` class to add an `avatarUrl` property that cannot be null:

```dart
class Member {
  final String login;
  final String avatarUrl;

  Member(this.login, this.avatarUrl) {
    if (login == null) {
      throw new ArgumentError("login of Member cannot be null. "
          "Received: '$login'");
    }
    if (avatarUrl == null) {
      throw new ArgumentError("avatarUrl of Member cannot be null. "
          "Received: '$avatarUrl'");
    }
  }
}
```

Update `_buildRow()` to show the avatar using a **NetworkImage** and the **CircleAvatar** widget:

```dart
Widget _buildRow(int i) {
  return new Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
    child: new ListTile(
      title: new Text("${_members[i].login}", style: _biggerFont),
      leading: new CircleAvatar(
        backgroundColor: Colors.green,
        backgroundImage: new NetworkImage(_members[i].avatarUrl)
      ),
    )
  );
}
```

By setting the avatar as the `leading` attribute of the `ListTile`, it will show before the title within the row. You've also set a background color on the image using the `Colors` class.

Now update `_loadData()` to use the "avatar_url" value in the map when creating a new `Member`:

```dart
final member = new Member(memberJSON["login"], memberJSON["avatar_url"]);
```

Build and run the app using F5. You'll see your member avatars now shown in each row:

<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/avatars.png"><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/avatars-281x500.png" alt="Showing avatars" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188656" /></a>

## Cleaning the Code

Most of your code is now in the **main.dart** file. To make the code a little cleaner, you can refactor the widget and other classes you've added into their own files.

Create files named **member.dart** and **ghflutter.dart** in the **lib** folder. Move the `Member` class into **member.dart** and both the `GHFlutterState` and `GHFlutter` classes into **ghflutter.dart**.

You won't need any `import` statments in **member.dart**, but the imports in **ghflutter.dart** should be as follows:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import 'member.dart';
import 'strings.dart';  
```

You also need to update the imports in **main.dart**, so that the entire file consists of the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'ghflutter.dart';
import 'strings.dart';

void main() => runApp(new GHFlutterApp());


class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: Strings.appTitle,
      home: new GHFlutter(),
    );
  }
}  
```

Build and run the app by hitting F5 and you should see no change, but the code is now a little cleaner. :]

## Adding a Theme

You can easily add a theme to the app by adding a **theme** attribute to the `MaterialApp` you create in **main.dart**:

```dart
class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: Strings.appTitle,
      theme: new ThemeData(primaryColor: Colors.green.shade800), 
      home: new GHFlutter(),
    );
  }
}  
```      

You're using a shade of green as a Material Design color value for the theme.

Build and run the app by hitting F5 to see the new theme in action:

Most of the app screenshots have been from the Android emulator. You can also run the final themed app in the iOS Simulator:

Now that's what I call cross-platform! :]

## Dart 2

A new version of Dart is on its way, <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/dart-2">Dart 2</a>. Among other things, Dart 2 adds **strong compile-time checks** and removes the need to use the `new` keyword when creating objects.

As an example, in Dart 2 the `_buildRow()` method would look something like:

```dart
_buildRow(int i) =>
  Padding(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
    child: ListTile(
        title: Text("${_members[i].login}", style: _biggerFont),
        leading: CircleAvatar(
          backgroundColor: Colors.green,
          backgroundImage: NetworkImage(_members[i].avatarUrl)
      ),
    )
  );
```

Instructions for trying out Dart 2 with Flutter can be found <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Trying-the-preview-of-Dart-2-in-Flutter">here</a>. There may be incompatibilities with your current projects, so be sure to run the 

```flutter analyze --preview-dart-2```

and

```flutter run --preview-dart-2```

commands if trying out Dart 2.

## Where to go from here?

You can download the completed project using the download button at the top or bottom of this tutorial.

You should be able to open the project in either VS Code or Android Studio. Open in VS Code by just opening the root folder. You'll need to fetch packages when opening the project.

To open the final project in Android Studio, choose **Open an existing Android Studio project** from the **Welcome to Android Studio** screen and naviagte to choose the root folder of the final project. You'll need to then choose "Open Flutter Settings" and set the Flutter SDK path to where you cloned the flutter git repo. Then choose "Get dependencies" on the "'Packages get' has not been run" line in Android Studio. Choose the **Project** view in the project panel to see your files.

If you're on macOS, you can run the app from Android Studio to either an Android emulator or the iOS Simulator. Try it, it's pretty cool! :]

There's a lot more to learn about Flutter and Dart. The best places to start are:

* The main Flutter page at <a href="http://flutter.io">flutter.io</a>. You'll find lots of great documentation and other information.
* See the available widgets <a href="https://flutter.io/widgets-intro/">here</a>.
* There's a great guide for Android developers transitioning to using Flutter <a href="https://flutter.io/flutter-for-android/">here</a>.
